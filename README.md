## **What it is**
It is a Batch program that fetches the Product Key you used to activate the instalation of Windows you are using.

## **How to Use**
Download the [File](https://github.com/OlaYZen/Windows-Activation-Key-Grabber/releases/download/Windows/WindowsActivationKeysGrabber.bat) and run it with Administrator privileges, should only take about a secound or two before you get your Windows Activation Key

## **Why should i get my Product Key**
Well if you want to install Widows 10 on a laptop or another desktop you can probably still use the same code on both pcs, and you don't need to pay mr bill gates more money

## **Is it Safe**
If you don't trust me, look though the code yourself, its only two lines :/

## **What does the Product Key look like?**
Well your code should look something like this **AAAAA-BBBBB-CCCCC-11111-22222**
